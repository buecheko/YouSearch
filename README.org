YouSearch is an interactive CLI to fetch transcripts of YouTube videos, 
browse them and jump to the corresponding position in the video.
** Requirements
   To play videos directly from the cli you need to install mpv and youtube-dl.

   On Arch based systems this can be done using pacman.
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   sudo pacman -S mpv youtube-dl
   #+END_SRC
