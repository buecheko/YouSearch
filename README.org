YouSearch is an interactive CLI to fetch transcripts of YouTube videos, 
browse them and jump to the corresponding position in the video.\\

This is still work in progress and comes with a few bugs. 
However, the core functions should already work.
** Requirements
   To play videos directly from the cli you need to install mpv and youtube-dl.

   On Arch based systems this can be done using pacman.
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   sudo pacman -S mpv youtube-dl
   #+END_SRC
** Installation
*** Using pip
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    pip install yousearch

    # Run it
    python -m yousearch
    #+END_SRC
*** Using poetry
    #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    git clone https://github.com/buecheko/YouSearch.git
    cd YouSearch
    
    poetry install
    
    # Run it 
    poetry run yousearch
    #+END_SRC
